            Egyptian Maus are a small- to medium-sized short-haired cat breed.</p>
        <p>
            The breed conformation is described as "a balance between the compactness of a Burmese and the slim elegance
            of a Siamese. Its medium-length body is muscular, with the hind legs longer than the front, giving the Mau
            the appearance of standing on tiptoes when upright."
